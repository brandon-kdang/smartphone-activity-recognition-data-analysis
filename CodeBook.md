##CodeBook for analysis result of the Smartphone Activity Recognition data

The analysis dataset is derived from the original dataset by combining test and train dataset into one, extract only the mean and standard deviation columns, and then derive the average for each variable for each activity for each subject. All columns use the same name and units as in the original dataset, except for two new columns that have been added as following:

activity: indicates the name of the activity. The value set is: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
subject: indicates the subject who carried out the experiment. The value range is 1..30

##The rest of the variables are the mean() and standard deviation (std()) values of the values in the original dataset, described as following:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
